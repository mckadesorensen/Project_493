# Project_493
This is the API of the webserver that we will practice attacking and improving the security of the API. We plan on using a EC2 instance as the server. We want to practice frequent web application attacks, such as xss and SQL hijacking, at the moment it has a homepage and a about page. loosely based off of Corey Schafer flask tutorial.

To run api_493.py you must install flask and a number of other packages. 
pip3 install flask
